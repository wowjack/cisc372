What a nightmare

I really tried my hardest here but I'm not sure what my program output looks like. Even the diff1d example would not work for me. It would compile fine but any time I tried to play the .mp4 file it would say its corrupted, No matter the software or platform I used. I tried just getting the .gif output but that doesn't work either. 

Its pretty hard to get things entirely right when you can't see the output. I ended up just printing the array doubles to the terminal to see the diffusion so I hope its good. After all we aren't graded on getting animation dependencies to work right?
