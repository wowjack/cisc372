(1) B
    In every proc, the send instruction comes before the recv instruction.
    If the send instruction waits to synchronize for its matching recv instruction, it will deadlock.
    This probably wont happen though because we're just sending one int.

(2) B
    Same deal as question 1.
    For procs 0 & 1, the send instruction comes before the recv instruction.
    If the send instruction waits to synchronize for its matching recv instruction, it will deadlock.
    This probably wont happen though because we're just sending one int.

(3) C
    Both procs 0 & 1 wait for a message from eachother before they send a message themselves.
    Each proc will forever wait for this message and will deadlock.

(4) A
    Each proc up to but not including nprocs-1 will send to rank+1
    Even if these send instructions wait to synchronize, proc nprocs-1 does not do any send.
    proc nprocs-2's send will synchronize with proc nprocs-1 recv instruction.
    Then proc nprocs-2 will recv and synchronize with nprocs-3 send instruction.
    This will continue down the chain until proc 1 recvs from proc 0, no deadlock.
