New frequency (GHz): 1
Explanation:

We want power consumption to be equal so
	numCores * (newFreq)^3 = 1 * (oldFreq)^3
	   8     * (newFreq)^3 = 1 * (   2   )^3
	(newFreq)^3 = 8/8
	(newFreq)^3 = 1
	newFreq = 1

If the 8 core version is to continue running at 100W, the new frequency must be 1GHz.
Assuming no overhead this offers a 4x performance increase.
