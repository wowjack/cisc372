	    Breakout Exercise for Class 18: OpenMP, part 2

First, introduce yourself to your partners in the breakout room.
Consider turning on your camera!

Work in your personal repo, directory breakout/class18. Talk with your
partners, share you screens, share your code.

Start by copying over the material in the class repo's breakout/class18
to your personal repo's breakout/class18.   (cp -r ...)

----------------------------------------------------

The first part of this exercise uses 10 little programs in directory
ex. Start with p1.c.   Choose one person to share the screen.   The
screen person opens the file in their favorite text editor.  Discuss
the program with your colleagues and try to answer the following:

   - Is the program correct or does it have some undefined behavior?
     If the latter, explain.

   - If the program is correct, what will the output be?

Write your answer in a plain text file named answers.txt in directory
ex.   The exact format is not important.

Now compile and run the program, perhaps multiple times.  Use all the
compiler warnings and flags you want.   Discuss.   Does anything change
your mind?  If so, adjust your answer.

Now rotate to a new person in your group and have them share their
screen. Repeat for p2.c, adding your answers to answers.txt. And so
on, for p3.c, ..., p10.c.

Commit your answers.txt.

----------------------------------------------------

If you finish that, go into directory diffusion1d. This is a simple
1d-diffusion animation. You can use the usual "make" rules to compile,
run, and test the program. Now the filename says "omp", but it is
really just the sequential version. Your job is to edit it, adding
openmp primitives appropriately. "make test" will tell you if your
changes were correct. Then see how much speedup you can get on the
"big" problem with "make big.anim".

Commit your modifications.

----------------------------------------------------

Ditto, with diffusion2d.  Even more challenging.
