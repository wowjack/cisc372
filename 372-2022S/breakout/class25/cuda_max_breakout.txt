		   Breakout for Class 25: CUDA MAX

Work in breakout/class25.

Read this out loud with the people in your group and discuss it.

Write a CUDA-C program to compute the maximum of sin(i) for i in 0
.. N-1.  Use double precision floating point numbers.  Call your
program max.cu.  Use either Beowulf or Bridges.  (Since there aren't
that many GPUs on Beowulf, you may find faster turnaround on Bridges.)

Your program should print out the answer to 20 decimal places, as well
as the total time in seconds.

Your goal is to find the answer for N=2^30. However it is recommended
you start with a much smaller value of N (but still a power of 2) as
you debug your code.

Discuss a general strategy with your partners before you start to
code.  There may be some examples in the code repo you can use as a
guide.

If time remains: print out not only the answer, but also a value of i
at which the maximum is achieved.
