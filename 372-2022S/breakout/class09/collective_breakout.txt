1. Write an MPI program mybcast.c that takes command line arguments
which are integers. Process 0 reads the arguments and converts them to
ints.  It then "broadcasts" all the ints to all processes.  Each
process prints the ints received:

  Proc X received: Y1 Y2 Y3 ...
  
Process 0 might have to first broadcast the number of arguments.

2. Write an MPI program myscatter.c that takes command line arguments
which are integers.  Process 0 reads the arguments and converts them
to ints.  It then "scatters" all the ints to all processes using the
standard block distribution scheme.  I.e., the array is broken up into
disjoint blocks and each process receives a block.  Each process
prints the ints received.

3. Modify diff1d_mpi.c so that it prints the average and minimum
temperature at the end.  (I.e, the average and minimum over all pixels
in the last time step.)    Call the program diff1dv2.c

4. Modify diff1d_mpi.c so that it takes a command line argument which
is a temperature (a double), called "threshold".  It stops as soon as
the average temperature is greater than or equal to the threshold.
Note all processes must stop and exit the main loop at the same time.
The program prints a message when and if this happens stating the
iteration number (time step) and the average temperature reached.
Call the program diff1dv3.c.
