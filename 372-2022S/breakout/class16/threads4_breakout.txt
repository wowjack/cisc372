Pthread Barrier Breakout Exercise

The usual: introduce yourself, work with your neighbors in breakout/class16.

Discuss this problem first before starting to hack.

In this exercise, you want to create a parallel version of diffuse1d.c
using Pthreads.  Call it diffuse1d_pthread.c.

Instead of creating a new team of threads at each time step, you will
create the threads once. Each thread will loop over the time
steps. (This is a bit like the MPI version.)  However, in order to
make this work, there is going to have to be some synchronization,
probably using a barrier. Discuss why barriers might be needed, and
come up with an outline of the new code showing where the barriers
should go. Then start to code it.

You can use any of the barriers in pthread/barrier. A Makefile is
provided which uses one of them.
