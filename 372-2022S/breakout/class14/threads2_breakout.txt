Create directory breakout/class14.  Get as far as you can on the
following exercises:

1. Write a Pthread program that deadlocks.  Call it deadlock.c.
Run it, and watch it deadlock.

2. Write a function that uses threads to compute the maximum value in
an array of doubles, and stores the result in global variable s. Use
standard block distribution to distribute the work among threads.
Put this function in a file named max.c.

3. Now test it as follows: add a main function which reads numbers
from the command line. The first number is the number of threads to
use, the remaining numbers are the elements of the array. The main
thread prints the result at the end.

4. Add a Makefile to compile the programs above and run tests.
