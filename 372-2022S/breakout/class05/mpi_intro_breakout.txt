First, introduce yourself to your partners for this class (the people
sitting on your side of the table).  Work together for the hour.

Work in directory breakout/class05. Commit all your work by end of
class.

1. Write a C/MPI program in which each process performs the following
actions in order:

 First:  print "i: hi\n" 10 times, where i is the rank.  fflush after each print.
 Then:   print "i: bye\n" 10 times, fflushing after each print.

Note: the above describes what one process should do.  Each process
does this same thing (except they each have their own rank).  There is
no coordination between processes.

Call the program hi10.c.  Compile and run the program with different
process counts.  Run it with 2 procs over and over again.  Do you ever
see anything strange?

Note: you can use your own machine if you've installed MPI.  You can also
use cisc372.cis.udel.edu by using srun to run the program.

-----

2. Modify hi10.c so that all the hi lines for all processes are
printed before any of the bye lines are printed. What function do you
need?

-----

3. Write a C/MPI program addints.c that adds the integer 1..10^9. Aim
for load balance for any process count. Be sure to use an integer type
that is big enough to hold the result!
