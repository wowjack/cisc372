1. Write the English name of the type of x:

(a) int *x[];
(b) unsigned long (*x[])[n];

2. Declare x to be a pointer to an array of doubles:


3. Consider the following code snippet:

void f(int a[1000]) {
  ...
}
int b[1000];
int main() {
  ...
  f(b);
  ...
}

How many bytes of data are copied from b to a in the
call f(b)?  Your answer should be a C expression.

[To be clear: we are just asking about the interval
that begins with the call to f and ends just after
a is initialized, before the body of f is executed.]
