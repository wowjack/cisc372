Write a C program that takes two arguments, n and m, on the command
line. Both are positive integers.

The program creates a 2-dimensional n x m array a of doubles, a[n][m].
It then initializes all the boundary cells to 100.0, and all the
interior points to 0.0. For example, if n=4 and m=5:

100   100   100   100   100
100     0     0     0   100
100     0     0     0   100
100   100   100   100   100

The program then prints the array, as shown in the example above.
(Except, one or 2 digits after the decimal point would be better.)


If you have time:

Write a function print2d that prints a 2d array of doubles. Figure out
what the arguments to print2d must be, and have your program call
print2d to print a.
