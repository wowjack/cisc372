Write a C program permute that takes a single command line argument,
which is a word. Say the word consists of n characters. The program
creates a 2d-array of dimensions n! x n (i.e., there are n factorial
rows, and n columns) of char. It then fills that array with all n!
permutations of the letters of the word. Finally, it prints the n!
permuted words.

Example:
> permute abc
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba


Hint: here is a recursive approach: you get all permutations of "abc"
by first taking a and appending all permutations of "bc", then take b
and append all permutations of "ac", then take c and append all
permutations of "ab". Write a recursive function that takes all the
appropriate inputs and fills in the array in that way.
