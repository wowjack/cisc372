OpenMP Part 4 Breakout

Work in directory breakout/class20 in your personal repo.

This exercise is left over from class18.  See the instructions for the
class18 breakout problems on diffusion1d and diffusion2d.  Copy the
diffusion1d and diffusion2d directories from class18 into your class20
directory and work there.   You may use cisc372 and/or bridges2.

If you finish both of those programs, you can then try to construct
"hybrid" versions that uses MPI and OpenMP in the same program.  Start
with a simple block-distributed MPI version.  Run one MPI process per
node, and then add OpenMP threads within a node to accelerate the
update loop.
