Do as much of this as you can in the time remaining:

Write a program that defines a structured type for a playing Card. A
Card has a "value" (1..13) and a "suit" (diamonds, clubs, hearts, or
spades). The suit should be defined as an enum.

Write a function "print_card" which prints a card like this: "Ace of
spades", "Two of hearts", "King of diamonds", etc. Note that Ace=1,
Jack=11, Queen=12, King=13.

Write a function "make_deck" which creates an array of cards of length
52, and fills it in with the 52 different possible cards.

Write a function "print_deck" which prints the deck, in order.

Write a function "destroy_deck" which destroys a deck.

Write a function "shuffle" which shuffles the deck randomly.

Write a main function which creates a deck, prints it, shuffles it,
prints it again, and destroys it.
