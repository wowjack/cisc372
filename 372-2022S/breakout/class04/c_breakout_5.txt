Write a C program "a2d.c" that takes two arguments, n and m, on the
command line. Both are positive integers.

1. Write a function "create" which creates a 2-dimensional n x m array
of doubles, allocating memory on the heap:

double ** create(int n, int m);

2. Write a function "init" which initializes a 2d array of doubles,
setting all boundary cells to 100.0, and all the interior points to
0.0. For example, if n=4 and m=5:

100   100   100   100   100
100     0     0     0   100
100     0     0     0   100
100   100   100   100   100

(Except, one or 2 digits after the decimal point would be better.) 
Figure out what the arguments to init should be.

3. Write a function "print" that prints a 2d array of doubles.

4. Write a function "destroy" that deallocates a 2d array of doubles.

5. The main function should read the command line arguments, then
call create, init, print, and destroy.
