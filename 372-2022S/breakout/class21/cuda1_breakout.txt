	    Breakout for Class 21: CUDA version of perfect

Work in breakout.class21.

Copy the sequential program perfect.c to this directory. Your goal is
to make a CUDA version perfect.cu. You do not need to count the total
number of perfect numbers found, just print them out as they are
found. Hence, this is an embarrassingly parallel problem.

Your CUDA kernel will need the following information:

   gridDim.x   : # blocks
   blockIdx.x  : ID number of this block
   blockDim.x  : # threads per block
   threadIdx.x : local ID number of this thread within the block

   gridDim.x * blockDim.x : global number of threads
   blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x : global thread ID number

Once a thread knows the total number of threads and its (global) ID,
it can go to town using the usual cyclic distribution technique.

Refers to the example hello world programs for some basic templates.
A Makefile is also provided.
