	       Breakout for Class 17: Beginning OpenMP

First, introduce yourself to your partners in the breakout room.
Consider turning on your camera!

Work in your personal repo, directory breakout/class17. Talk with your
partners, share you screens, share your code.

In this directory is a silly program that takes any number of command
line arguments (strings) and prints something based on them.  Compile
and run it and see what it does.

Write a parallel version of this program using OpenMP.  Call it
knights_omp.c.  You may use only the following OpenMP constructs:

#pragma omp parallel
omp_get_num_threads()
omp_get_thread_num()

Parallelize as much of the program as possible.  Your parallel program
should be functionally equivalent to the original.
