These are breakout problems, meaning you are supposed to work on them
in small groups.  In Zoom, you should take turns sharing your screens
and you should be talking to each other.  Help each other overcome
various hurdles you may encounter.


You can do this on your own computer, assuming you have a Unix
environment.  Otherwise ssh to cisc372.cis.udel.edu and do it there.

You should have received your password for your personal 372
Subversion repository. Do the following steps. Talk with your
colleagues in the breakout room and share screens to discuss any
issues.

1. Change into your home directory, if you are not already there
   (cd ~).

2. Check out your personal repository, if you have not already
   done so:
     svn checkout --username USER svn://vsl.cis.udel.edu/cisc372/372-USER
     replace USER with your user name
     enter your personal repository password when prompted

3. Change into the root of the local copy of your personal repository
   (cd 372-USER).

4. Create a directory named breakout and change into it.

5. Create a directory named class02 and change into it.

6. Create a file named foo.txt in the current directory.

7. Create a directory named A in the current directory.

8. Copy foo.txt to A.  Check that both copies are really there.

9. Change back to the root of the local copy of your personal
   repository.  Make sure you are in the right directory (pwd).

10. Add your work to version control (svn add breakout).

11. Commit your work with a short log message:
    svn commit
    Look at the list of files being added and make sure they are correct
    before proceeding.  (This is a good habit and will prevent you
    from committing a lot of junk to your repo.)
    Add the message "Finished my first breakout" in the text editor.
    Save the log message and exit the editor.

That's all you have to do for this first breakout exercise.
Now go to the second.
