1. Create a simple Makefile for compiling hi.c.

2. Delete hi.

3. Type make.  This should re-create hi.

4. Type hi and make sure it still works.

5. Type make again.    Nothing to do!

6. Edit hi.c by changing the "Hi" to "Bye".

7. Type make again.  It should re-build.

8. Type hi again.  You should see the new message.

9. Type make again.  Nothing to do.

10. Commit Makefile to version control.

11. Instruct Subversion to ignore hi and any file with name
    ending in "~":

    svn propedit svn:ignore .
    using the editor, put these two lines in the file:
hi
*~
    save and exit

12. svn commit once more

13. Type svn status.  Are the files ignored?

That's it for today.
Do you have any questions?
