1. Change back into directory breakout/class02 in your personal repo.

2. Create a directory named ex2, add it to version control, and change into it.

3. Create a new file named hi.c with these contents:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("Hi there\n");
}

4. Compile the program: cc -o hi hi.c

5. List the directory.  You should see a file hi.

6. Ensure that anyone can execute hi.

7. Execute hi: ./hi

8. Put the directory containing hi in your PATH.

9. Change into some other directories and type hi.

   Congrats: you have extended the language of your OS!

10. Commit hi.c (but not hi) to version control.

Once you are done with this, move on to the third part.
