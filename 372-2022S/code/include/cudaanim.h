/* ANIM library, by Stephen F. Siegel, University of Delaware, 2020.

   ANIM is a simple C library for creating animations from scientific
   programs.  The following kinds of animations are supported:

   HEAT: a real-valued function is defined at each point in a 1d, 2d,
   or 3d spatial domain.  The value of the function changes with time.
   At any point in time, the values of the function are displayed by
   pixel color, where the colors lie on a blue-red spectrum, with blue
   representing the lowest value, and red the highest.

   GRAPH: a real-valued function is defined at each point in a 1d or
   2d spatial domain.  The function changes with time.  At each point
   in time, the values are displayed as a graph, i.e, as a set of
   points (x,f(x)) in the x-y plane for the 1d case, or as a set of
   points (x,y,f(x,y)) in the x-y-z space in the 2d case.  Note the
   dimension of the graph itself is one higher than the dimension of
   its domain.

   NBODY: some fixed number of bodies is specified.  Each body has a
   fixed color and radius, and is represented as a solid sphere of
   that radius and color.  The dimension of the spatial domain can be
   1, 2, or 3.  The bodies move with time.  At each point in time, the
   position of each body is specified and the bodies are displayed at
   those points.

   An animation is created by one of the ANIM_Create* functions, which
   creates a new file and returns a handle to it.  Frames are added to
   this file by function ANIM_Write_frame.  The file is closed with
   ANIM_Close.  The file created is in a binary format called "ANIM
   format" and usually ends with suffix .anim.  Separate utilities can
   be used to transform the file to an animated GIF (.gif) or MPEG
   movie (.mp4).
